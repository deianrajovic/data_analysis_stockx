# Data Analysis Project - Stockx 

The dataset that we used come from StockX, a startup company that built a resell marketplace for buying and selling sneakers, watches and clothing. The company is born 5 years ago and is expanding at an incredible speed, now counting more than 800 employees. Since the primary market of Stockx are sneakers, our dataset is based on two of the most famous brands on that market of recent years, Yeezy and “Nike x Off-White”.
