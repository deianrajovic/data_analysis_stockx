Deian: First Week Data Cleaning.
Deian: One dataframe for each year (df_2010, df_2011, ...)

Deian: Upload data and first cleaning activities... it is necessary to understand the meaning of the various codes (probably describe the type of firm etc.)

Andrea: Deleting ATECO column. We can use the NACE 2007, which is the european equivalent of ATECO.

        I don't undestand the reason of using the unique function.
        
        In order to understand the meaning of CLLVT, I'm going to filter the year2020 dataframe selecting Data type == email only.
        Then, I'm going to sort the column 'value' and confront the lowest value in the output with the lowest value showed in the istat site.
        By doing so, I think we can find information on how to interpret all the codes that should refer to each type of industry.
        I've tried to directly search them on google and in ATECO's documents but I didn't find anything.
        
        I think we can use https://colab.research.google.com/ to share and edit the notebook. It can also be linked to GitHub.

Andrea: Use this link to edit the notebook  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TQJ78tyNCffee54j8D4hlT-_MQ5nwOYe?usp=sharing
        It takes the CSV from my google drive but you should not have any problem
        Further comments has been inserted inside the notebook.
